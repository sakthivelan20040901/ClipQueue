# 📋 ClipMerge

**ClipMerge** is a lightweight, open-source clipboard enhancer built with [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/). It lets you **append multiple copied texts** into memory and paste them all together — without saving anything to disk.

⚡ Perfect for developers, writers, students, and anyone juggling multiple snippets.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ `Ctrl + Shift + C` → Append selected text to memory  
- ✅ `Ctrl + Shift + V` → Paste all collected snippets  
- ✅ `Ctrl + Shift + X` → Clear the clipboard memory  

> Everything runs silently in the background — no UI, no file storage, just pure in-memory magic.
